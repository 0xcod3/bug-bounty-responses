Hi {{username}},

Thank you for submitting a report. The fact that our CSP includes `unsafe-inline` is not an issue in itself. We will accept this report if you can find a way of actually exploiting this potential issue with XSS, for example.

Keep up the good work and we look forward to seeing what you find in the future!
