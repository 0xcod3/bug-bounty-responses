Hi {{username}},

Thank you for reporting this to us. The page in question is static, therefore clickjacking does not pose any risk. Clickjacking becomes an issue whenever the page is dynamic and enable a user/attacker to perform sensitive actions such as deleting one's account.

One good way of finding valid clickjacking vulnerabilities is to create a map of the various functionality and then checking the actions that could have a significant impact on the user.

Keep up the good work and we look forward to more reports from you in the future!
