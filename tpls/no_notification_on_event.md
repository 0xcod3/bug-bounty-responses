Hi {{username}},

We have determined that this event does not require any notifications and that the risk of having no notification is not significant enough to warrant an immediate fix.

On a side note, we highly recommend you take a look at _["Web Hacking 101"](https://leanpub.com/web-hacking-101)_ by Peter Yaworski and _["Breaking into Information Security: Learning the Ropes 101"](https://leanpub.com/ltr101-breaking-into-infosec)_ by Andy Gill to get a better idea of the type of issues that we are looking for.

Happy hacking and make sure to report back if you find anything interesting.
