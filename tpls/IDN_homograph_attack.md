Hi {{username}},

We do not consider IDN homograph attacks to be a significant threat and do not plan on addressing this concern at the moment.

On a side note, we highly recommend you take a look at _["Web Hacking 101"](https://leanpub.com/web-hacking-101)_ by Peter Yaworski and _["Breaking into Information Security: Learning the Ropes 101"](https://leanpub.com/ltr101-breaking-into-infosec)_ by Andy Gill to get a better idea of the type of issues that we are looking for.

We look forward to more reports from you in the future!
