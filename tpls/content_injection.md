Hi {{username}},

Thank you very much for your report. We generally do not accept content injection reports. The severity of this issue is so low that it does not warrant an immediate fix. We are aware that other 
bug bounty programs might interpret this issue differently, but we have accepted the low risk that content injection poses.

Keep up the good work and we look forward to more reports from you in the future!
