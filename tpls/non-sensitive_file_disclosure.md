Hi {{username}},

The file that you listed above does not appear to disclose any sensitive information that could potentially affect us or our customers. That being said, we really appreciate you taking the time to report something to us and we highly recommend to always verify the contents of a file to ensure that it really is a security issue.

On a side note, we highly recommend you take a look at _["Web Hacking 101"](https://leanpub.com/web-hacking-101)_ by Peter Yaworski and _["Breaking into Information Security: Learning the Ropes 101"](https://leanpub.com/ltr101-breaking-into-infosec)_ by Andy Gill to get a better idea of the type of issues that we are looking for.

Keep up the good work and we look forward to more reports from you in the future!
