Hi {{username}},

Thank you for reporting a potential issue to us. Currently, we do not plan on changing this behaviour. The ability to create external links is a fundamental part of the web and users are educated to wary of what they click on while browsing.

Keep up the good work and we look forward to more reports from you in the future!
