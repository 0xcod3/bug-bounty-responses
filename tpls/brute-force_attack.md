Hi {{username}},

Thank you very much for your report. We generally do not accept these type of reports. We are aware that other bug bounty programs might interpret this issue differently, but we have accepted the low risk that brute-force attacks pose.

On a side note, we highly recommend you take a look at _["Web Hacking 101"](https://leanpub.com/web-hacking-101)_ by Peter Yaworski and _["Breaking into Information Security: Learning the Ropes 101"](https://leanpub.com/ltr101-breaking-into-infosec)_ by Andy Gill to get a better idea of the type of issues that we are looking for.

Keep up the good work and we look forward to more reports from you in the future!
