Hi {{username}},

Thank you for reporting this to us. Open redirects in the *Host* header are not exploitable therefore currently do not see a reason to change this behaviour. That being, said if you do find a way to really exploit this in a way that it could affect us and/or our users, please do report
back to us.

Keep up the good work and we look forward to more reports from you in the future!
