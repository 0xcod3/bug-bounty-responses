Hi {{username}},

We appreciate the fact that you took the time to report this to us. The JavaScript error does not disclose any sensitive information, therefore we do not plan on fixing this anytime soon. Always make sure that when you believe you have encountered some form of information disclosure to double-check that the information is in fact sensitive. If you are not very familiar with the error message or the technology being used, a quick Google search can usually help.

Keep up the good work and we look forward to more reports from you in the future!
