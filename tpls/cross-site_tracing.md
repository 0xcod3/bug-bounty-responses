Hi {{username}},

In order for Cross-Site Tracing (XST) to really be a significant issue you would need to find an endpoint vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). If you do find XSS, please notify us, and we will accept this report.

Keep up the good work and we look forward to seeing what you find in the future!
